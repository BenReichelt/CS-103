// Exercise 3: 
/* In this problem you will write 
   a simple Python program that computes the 
   integers 0 through 4 using expressions involving 
   exactly four fours and no other numbers. 
   Your expressions may use any of the following
   operators: +, -, *, / and parentheses. 
   Your expressions may not use anything else 
   except these operators and the numeral 4.
*/

// For example:

let zero = 4 + 4 - 4 - 4
console.log(zero)

// look at the console to see numeral 0. 

// Now, do the rest in the following lines

let one = 4 * 4 / 4 / 4
console.log(one)

let two = 4 / 4 + 4 / 4
console.log(two)

let three = (4 * 4 - 4) / 4
console.log(three)

let four = (4 - 4) * 4 + 4
console.log(four)
