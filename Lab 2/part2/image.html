<h1><b>A look at Kapa'a:</b></h1>
<h2>One of Earth's hidden beauties</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>

<p>After my Sophomore year in college, I took a trip to Hawaii and visited what <em>quickly</em> became one of my favorite places on Earth, Kauai. I was enthralled with the natural beauty of the landscapes, wildlife, and environment of the island. Here are a few pictures showing some examples of the island's beauty by showcasing the city of Kapa'a.</p>

<p>Since Kauai is an island, the entire coast is filled with gorgeous coastal scenery</p>

<p>While hiking and exploring, it is common to see natural features that give you a full sense of appreciation for nature, as well as the effect of the passage of time on the environment.</p>

<p>It is <em>common</em> to see chickens and roosters roaming the streets of Kapa'a similarly to how squirrels and pigeons roam the city of Boston. The chickens have free reign because a natural predator was never introduced to the island, hence Kauai's nickname of "Chicken Island".</p>
