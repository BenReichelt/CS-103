					<h3>What do I like to do?</h3>
					<p>In my free time away from my studies you'll likely find me doing one of a few things:</p>
						<ol>
							<li class="topic">Skateboarding:</li>
								<p>I love skateboarding, and recently started riding a board called a "Onewheel" which is essentially a giant tire with a gyroscope keeping it upright that is motion controlled. It's a lot of fun to say the least.</p>
								<p class="recommendation">Recommendation: <a href="https://onewheel.com/">Onewheel</a></p>
							<li class="topic">Games:</li>
								<p>Board games, video games, puzzles, I love em all.</p>
								<p class="recommendation">Recommendation: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/">Portal</a></p>
							<li class="topic">Reading</li>
								<p>When it's warm out, there's a good chance I'd be on the Esplanade, working my way through a novel, sitting on a bench.</p>
								<p class="recommendation">Recommendation: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Road-Cormac-McCarthy/dp/0307387895">The Road</a></p>
							<li class="topic">Film</li>
								<p>I personally feel that film is one of the greatest art forms. It's a specific combination of visuals and audio that work together to convey some message or emotion. That's awesome.</p>
								<p class="recommendation">Recommendation: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2">Fargo</a></p>
